  <h2>Why</h2>

<p> Our local governments collect and retain
mountains of valuable data. However, this data
lives and dies within the bounds of city hall.
Communities and organizations across the country
have demonstrated how we can use this open data
to make our lives more awesome. Help us in our
mission to start the open data revolution right
here in Fargo! </p>
